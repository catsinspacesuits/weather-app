The Weather in GIFs

This app allows users to search for a city/town and the weather forecast is returned to them in the form of a GIF that represents the current weather. Weather parameters are fetched from the Open Weather Map API. Temperature, wind speed and humidity are returned as well as a brief weather decription of the location. 

You can visit the app at: https://weather-in-gifs.herokuapp.com/

Ruby version 2.6.0 and Rails version 5.2.3 are used. Feature and functional tests are done with RSpec and Capybara.
