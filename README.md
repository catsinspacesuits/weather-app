The Weather in GIFs

This app allows users to search for a city/town and the weather forecast is returned to them in the form of a GIF that represents the current weather. Weather parameters are fetched from the Open Weather Map API. Feature and functional test are done with RSpec and Capybara.

You can visit the app at: https://weather-in-gifs.herokuapp.com/

Ruby version 2.6.0 and Rails version 5.2.3 are used.
